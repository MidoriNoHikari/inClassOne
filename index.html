	    Paragon: </br>
		Paragon is not your typical MOBA (Massive Online Battle Arena) like League of Legends or DOTA2. This game, currently in it's beta-testing phase, offers the strategy of the usual MOBA combined with all of the thrill of a 3rd-Person Shooter. While I can't say much more since it is still in beta, you should check it out at <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/paragon" target=_blank>www.epicgames.com/paragon</a>
